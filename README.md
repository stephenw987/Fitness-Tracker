## Description

The Fitness Tracker is a MERN-stack application on one page that allows Users to log in with JWT authentication, creating a secure access to saved fitness sessions stored in MongoDB. As developed, the app is accessible through a public web deployment (e.g., Render) or locally via VS Code.

Publicly deployed, sessions/entries are held within a Mongo NoSQL database and made accessible through the Web, if publicly deployed.

The Fitness Tracker source code is published on GitHub, and may be cloned to the local computers to run local versions.


## Installation

The Fitness Tracker source code may be downloaded from its GitHub repository, and run directly by a hosting computer, or through a Web hosting service (e.g., Render, Heroku).

Fitness Tracker requires render and building of client and server aspects. It would then be accessible by designated port located in `./server/server.js`


## Usage

Fitness Tracker is intended for use by one or more Users to record their fitness sessions/entries that will be held remotely and locally, and persist across multiple sessions. 

Users of Fitness Tracker on a remote or local instance will only have access to their individual entries.
